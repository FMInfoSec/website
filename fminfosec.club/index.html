      <h2>Regarding COVID-19 and Social Distancing</h2>
      <p>FMInfoSec events will be organized according to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html">guidelines
          for social gatherings</a> put forth by the US Centers for Disease Control. Currently, the CDC recommends that
        social gatherings should be canceled or postponed if proper social distancing (more than 6 feet between
        attendees of different households) cannot be maintained. Due to the conversational nature of our events, this
        social distancing is not possible. Desiring to continue to provide the benefits of our community to our members,
        we will be scheduling regular online meetups. If you would like an invite to our events,
        please email

      <h2>About FMInfoSec</h2>
      <p>FMInfoSec is a casual, no agenda meetup with the purpose of bringing together those who work information
        security and those non-professionals who have an interest or talent for technology and hacking. Our goal is to
        be the catalyst for building friendships, creating collaborations, and sharing knowledge and stories. The
        discussion does not necessarily need to be information security focused. Our main goal is for attendees to have
        fun while getting to know each other.</p>
      <p>The idea for a meetup started in March 2018 at DakotaCon 8, where a number of conference attendees from Fargo
        ended up at the same table during the evening reception on Saturday. They discussed how none of them saw each
        other outside of conferences and how great it would have been to have an occasional get-together. A few months
        later, the first FMInfoSec meetup was held at Front Street Taproom with just 4 attendees. Since then it has
        become more well known throughout the community while also staying a small and close-knit group, drawing in
        professionals, students, and interested citizens alike.</p>
      <p>We&rsquo;re glad you found your way to our site, and we hope to see you at an upcoming event soon!</p>
