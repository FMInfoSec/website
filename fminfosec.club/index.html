      <h2>Why does this site look so basic?</h2>
      <p>If you've visited this site in the past, then the recent change is probably a bit of a shock.  Unfortunately, I had an error with the way the previous site was constructed that I was unable to fix.  Since I've been working on a revamped static site for a little while, I simply accelerated its implementation.  I will continue to improve the site over time, so please be patient with the current progress.</p>

      <h2>About FMInfoSec</h2>
      <p>FMInfoSec is a casual, no agenda meetup with the purpose of bringing together those who work information security and those non-professionals who have an interest or talent for technology and hacking.  Our goal is to be the catalyst for building friendships, creating collaborations, and sharing knowledge and stories.  The discussion does not necessarily need to be information security focused.  Our main goal is for attendees to have fun while getting to know each other.</p>
      <p>The idea for a meetup started in March 2018 at DakotaCon 8, where a number of conference attendees from Fargo ended up at the same table during the evening reception on Saturday.  They discussed how none of them saw each other outside of conferences and how great it would have been to have an occasional get-together.  A few months later, the first FMInfoSec meetup was held at Front Street Taproom with just 4 attendees.  Since then it has become more well known throughout the community while also staying a small and close-knit group, drawing in professionals, students, and interested citizens alike.</p>
      <p>We&rsquo;re glad you found your way to our site, and we hope to see you at an upcoming event soon!</p>
