FMInfoSec is a local meetup of information security professionals and non-professionals interested in InfoSec.  This repository contains the front-end website code and support files for the development for [fminfosec.club](https://fminfosec.club).

## Acknowledgements

- I based the design for this website off of ReconSec's [OpenSOC](opensoc.io) homepage, since I really liked the way they did their one-page design.
