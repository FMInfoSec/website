FMInfoSec is a local meetup of information security professionals and non-professionals interested in InfoSec.  This repository contains the front-end website code and support files for the development for [fminfosec.club](https://fminfosec.club).

## Acknowledgements

- Even though this website is very basic by comparison, I drew some inspiration for the one-page design from ReconSec's [OpenSOC](opensoc.io) homepage.
